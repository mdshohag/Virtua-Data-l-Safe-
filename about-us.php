					<p>On a regular basis thousands of people purchase insurance policies. Insurance policies are purchased so that the insured can provide security and peace of mind for his/her loved ones. These policies can provide long term financial security, replace lost income or pay final expenses. Despite this advanced planning by the insured, unclaimed life insurance payouts are over 1 BILLION DOLLARS. Thousands of people pass away with their loved ones not knowing if a policy exists and/or how to access assets that are rightfully theirs.<br>
					The odds that you have a lost, forgotten, or unknown policy are about 1 out of 600. As an industry wide practice, insurance companies don’t take the time to locate the beneficiaries of the policies.</p><br>
